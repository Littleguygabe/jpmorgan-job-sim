# any trade agreement is as valuable as the price you can sell minus the price at which you are able to buy. 
# Any cost incurred as part of executing this agreement is also deducted from the overall value.
    # basically value of the agreement is:
#       sell price - (buy price + execution costs)   (so total diff between selling value and cost)

# from example:
#   calculate the value before any execution costs, then subtract the execution costs from the value if there were no extra costs
